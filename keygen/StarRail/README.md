**GetVideoVersionKeyScRsp** need to be captured by packet sniffer tools like [Iridium-SR](https://github.com/tamilpp25/Iridium-SR) from game packet.

**VideoConfig** can extract from design data or get from [dim's repo](https://github.com/Dimbreath/StarRailData)

Very thanks Tart for providing GetVideoVersiobKeyScRsp packet data
